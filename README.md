# Advanced Quiz App

This is a Advanced project of the same quiz app(Project-2) which I learnt though Udemy's course on Flutter development.This app contains multiple screens,some of those are StartScreen,QuestionScreen and the ResultScreen.
Hoping to update it more after I advance in this sector ahead.
