# Advanced Quiz App

This is a Advanced project of the same quiz app(Project-2) which I learnt though Udemy's course on Flutter development.This app contains multiple screens,some of those are StartScreen,QuestionScreen and the ResultScreen.
Hoping to update it more after I advance in this sector ahead.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
